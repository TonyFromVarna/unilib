The goal of presented work is to realize distributed university library system with online access point.

The nodes of distributed system are the individual
autonomous single database systems of university libraries contained
information about available issues (like books, journals, newspapers etc.).
The users of the system after registration can use variety of services like
search by multiple parameters (title, author, type of media, publisher and
keywords), loan and get books out or check for loaned issues. There is an
opportunity to get detail information for library content. The application is
intuitive and easy to use with minimal requirements to its clients â€“ they
have to use some of the most widespread browsers supported JavaScript
and CSS (the application is tested with Internet Explorer, Firefox and
Opera). The presented three-tier application is based entirely on java
technologies - JSP and java beans for client side; RMI for communication
between web client and remote server and JDBC for connection to database
and consequently the system is platform independent and applicable to
many different possible relational database systems. Three-tier architecture
allow any of the tiers to be upgraded changed or replaced independently as
result of users requirements.
